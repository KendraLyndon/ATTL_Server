        title: "Feedback on the song \"Wherever You Go\"",
        text: [
          "In July 2013, the song \"Wherever You Go\" was selected through a blinded submission process for the First Act Feedback Fest contest in New York City sponsored by MusicalWriters.com and Theater Resources Unlimited (TRU). By \"blinded\" this meant that the evaluators did not know who submitted the song. This helps to eliminate the bias that can enter a contest because of people being well known, or in this case, unknown.",
          "The song was chosen as a \"Turnaround\" song, or a song that changes a character's mind about something. The song was presented by New York professionals and a rehearsal was done shortly after Brenda and Kathee arrived in New York (at the same rehearsal hall frequented by many famous singers). The contest included a panelist of industry experts as well as an audience with 12 writing teams presenting in the day long workshop.",
          "Brenda and Kathee found it fascinating to see aspects of other musicals presented and learned a great deal from the panelist feedback. It was gratifying first, to be selected for the contest, and second, to have positive and very constructive feedback on the song. That was not a universal experience for everyone who was part of the contest.",
          "Here's part of Kathee's email after the experience: \"I got to have some of the most iconic of New York experiences - starting with the wild taxi ride from La Guardia into downtown Manhattan at rush hour to make it to our rehearsal with our (wonderful) performers.  And the subway rides, the sassy deli waitress with the Brooklyn accent, seeing a Broadway show (Phantom) and the 9/11 memorial.  Man!\"",
          "The comments above are from two panelists and one of the contest sponsors."
