        bio: [
          "Brenda starting writing songs for her own amusement while in high school assuming this was normal and never took her songwriting very seriously until much, much later. Acting and singing was taken seriously starting in middle school, through college, and into her adult years. After moving to Seattle, she took vocal coaching from Marianne Weltmann and sang one season with the Opus 7 Vocal Ensemble directed by Loren Pontén.",
          "Brenda's musical theatre roles have included Miss Minchin in \"A Little Princess\" at Bethany Community Church and productions on the Newport Covenant Church stage in \"Godspell\", \"The Sound of Music\", and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".",
          "In her adulthood, Brenda found that that seed of songwriting had grown deeper and the songs she best loved to write were for musicals. Brenda wrote two songs for the original youth musical \"High Flying Guitars\" with book by Wendy Wiley which was presented at Newport Covenant in 2008.",
          "She partnered with Kathleen Lyndon about 10 years ago to write \"A Time to Live\" which has had three readings and multiple revisions (with many songs relegated to 'the trunk'). In 2013, the song \"Wherever You Go\" from \”A Time to Live\” was selected to be presented at The First Act Feedback Fest in New York, which was sponsored by Theatre Resources Unlimited (TRU) and MusicalWriters.com. It received very favorable and constructive feedback from a panel of industry veterans, including a Tony winner.",
          "Brenda is delighted to see \"A Time to Live\" as a full production and is honored to have this as her directorial premier as well. For the software geeks reading this, Brenda is an experienced software product manager and is applying Agile principles to the production process of \"A Time to Live\", complete with a Scrum Master (who doubles as Ahaz).",
          "Special thanks to Jerry Piger, her piano arranger and encourager for many years, dear husband Jim, the art show director (see it at intermission of the show!), son David for creating the poster, and dear friends Laura and Vicky for loving support. To God be the glory."

      bio:"I began accompanying at church and for choirs at school at twelve years old and continued through high school. I received a BA in music from Wheaton College. I was employed by the Huron Playhouse (in conjunction with Bowling Green State University in Ohio) as a rehearsal/performance accompanist during and after college, playing approximately two musicals each summer, including: Oklahoma, Carousel, Once Upon a Mattress, Music Man, You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown, and Little Mary Sunshine.  I also played a few high school musicals. In 1999 I began teaching piano lessons full-time before my children came along. I occasionally still help prepare pianists wanting extra help in their college audition preparation and accompanying soloists--both vocalists and instrumentalists. I accompanied the Newport Kids Players and the adult choir at Newport Covenant Church for a few years.  When Newport Covenant Church began to put on musicals in 2010 I began to accompany those: including Godspell, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, and Camelot.  I also recently played for the Cabaret “We’re All in This Together” at Luther’s Table. I currently enjoy accompanying Good News Group, a 5th-7th grade choir at Bellevue Presbyterian Church. I am honored to work with Brenda and Kathee and the incredible group they have assembled for this show."
